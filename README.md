# Promptly

**Promptly** is your personal, voice-first AI assistant that responds to a daily preset prompt — with answers customized to your preferences.
Just speak to Promptly each day using custom preset prompt. It listens, applies your preset prompt style, uses a powerful LLM, and speaks the answer back to you out loud.

### 🧠 Core Idea

> "Your voice + your prompt + your LLM = your personal oracle."

Promptly is not a chatbot.  
It’s a daily ritual — hands-free, voice-in, voice-out.  
You ask. It answers. You move on.
